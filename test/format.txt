<id>;<source>;<value>;<time>;<source-position>;<source-orientation>;<error>

<source> --- identifier of data source. Now variants are:
	1 - accelX
	1 - accelY
	3 - accelZ
	7 - range finder

<time> --- timestamp of data grabbing moment. Floating-point value

<source-position> --- 3 comma-separated coordinates of data source in chosen unified coordinate system linked with vehicle (now - cartesian with the center of mass as O). 3 floating-point values.

<source-orientation> --- 3 comma-separated floating-point angles (ro, phi, theta)

<value> --- data from source. Now it is one (scalar) value, floating-point.

<error> --- min-squared error of measured data.
